Overview:  To learn Ruby and Test Driven Development, I was tasked to create a command line program that would generate what the `cal month/year` or `cal year` would generate.  While generating this program I was suppose to create tests to lead me to my final development.

Project status:

-Month class is created and can generate what `cal month/year` can
-Tests are developed and passed for Month class
-Year class is created and can generate what `cal year` can
-Tests are still in development for this process







unit test for my Cal project:

1. its_a_century_leap_year
2. its_not_a_century_leap_year
3. its_a_non_century_leap_year
4. its_not_a_non_century_leap_year
5. number_month (converting a integer to a string of the month title)
6. num_of_days_in_month (# of days in a month)
7. num_of_days_in_february_in_a_leap_year
8. num_of_days_in_february_not_in_a_leap_year
9. first_weekday_of_month
10. first_day_of_february_in_a_leap_year
11. first_day_of_January
12. print_month_header
13. print_days_of_the_week_with_month_header
14. format_days_of_month
15. print_cal
